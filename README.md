Website Information Extractor
This is a Python script that extracts information from a website and saves it to a CSV file. The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the website and extract the desired information.

Installation
To use this script, you will need to have Python 3 and the BeautifulSoup library installed on your computer. You can install BeautifulSoup using pip:

Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4
Once you have installed Python and BeautifulSoup, you can download the website_info_extractor.py file from this repository and save it to your desired directory.

Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command line and provide the URL of the website you want to extract information from, as well as the HTML tags and attributes that contain the information you want to extract. Here's an example:

arduino
Copy code
python website_info_extractor.py https://www.example.com h1 class=title
In this example, the script will extract the text inside the <h1> tag with the class title from the website at https://www.tablelog.com and save it to a CSV file in the same directory as the script.

You can also customize the script to extract different types of information from the website by modifying the HTML tags and attributes in the code. The script includes comments to help you understand how to do this.
